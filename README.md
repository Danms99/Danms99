- 👋 Hi, I’m @Danms99
- 👀 I’m interested in all types of things related with technology such us aviation mechanics (currently working as an aircraft maintenance technician) or all things related with computer science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software engineering at UOC (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya) now im on the 3rd term.
- 💞️ Right now I just created this profile as part of a project for the university but by the time i would like to understand more this tool and see what is capable of. Hope in the future I can collaborate with other projects.
